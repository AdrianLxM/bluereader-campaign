———— About me:
I try to use technology to make all the stuff in my life easier.
As a diabetic I`m very dependent on technology and try to to stay on top of all new developments and technologies to make my life better and easier.
Because of that, I learned about the Freestyle-Libre system for checking my Glucose levels and started a journey to Reverse engineer the necessary parts of the system to built a realtime Glucose monitoring system with it.
With the help of a steady growing community, I was able to built the first prototypes, resulting in this campaign to get this technology to as many people as possible.
