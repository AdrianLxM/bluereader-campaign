———— Short Description:
blueReader – the easy way to read NFC tags wirelessly via bluetooth
Supports all formats, even medical systems like Abbott's Freestyle-Libre.
[ images just show prototypes (fully functional) ]


———— Realisation period:
October to December 2016

———— What is this project all about
This project aims to develop a device called [b]blueReader[/b] to readiness for series-production.

The [b]blueReader[/b] will provide the posibility to read NFC tags via a bluetooth connection from a PC or smartphones that don't have built in NFC technology.

The idea for this project arose when Abbott's latest product, the Freestyle-Libre, came to market. A system that can measure the interstitial glucose level. To display the values either a dedicated hand-held device or a smartphone with NFC capabilities is used, that read sensor via NFC technology.
I wanted to have these features on my devices that don't have built in NFC capabilities, especially iOS devices

The solution consists of a system, the [b]blueReader[/b] that can read the data via NFC technology and forwards it via bluetooth to another device.

The [b]blueReader[/b] only exists as a set of fully functional prototypes. 
The depicted circuit boards and drawings are taken form the the development steps of the device. 
The finished  device will just be slightly bigger than the Libre sensor and fully waterproof.

This fund-raiser provides the basis to finish the product and provide it to the general public. Not only will the device be able to be bought ready-made, but furthermore the full source code, wiring diagrams and information about this device will be provided.

The main part of the budget will be used for tests and certification of conformity (CE) and electromagnetic compatibility. disposal fees of rechargeable batteries, official bluetooth registration and test production. The [b]blueReader[/b] itself is already developed by me and an electrical engineer to preproduction maturity.

———— What is the project Goal and who is the project for:
The goal is to mature the [b]blueReader[/b] to series production and obtain the needed certifications for an electrical device in order to distribute and sell the blueReader.

The project will be interesting for people that use such a glucose monitor and want  more freedom and control over their  blood glucose levels, and also for any other that want to use NFC technology with their existing devices and upgrade them with this capability cost-efficiently.
